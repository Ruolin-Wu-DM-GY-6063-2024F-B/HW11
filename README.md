# HW11

This is what I did at the breadboard(a little bit abstract, sorry):
In one word, is I connect with the D11,D10,D9,D8,D4,D2.

And I make 1 LED blink every 1 second, 1 LED blink every 3 seconds, 1 LED blink every 5 senconds.
And another 3 LEDs for calculate the time, 1 LED will light after 15 seconds, 1 will light after 30 seconds, 1 will light after 45 seconds.

This is the Video:
